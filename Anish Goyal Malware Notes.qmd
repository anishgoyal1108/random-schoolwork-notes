## Trojan horses
- Do exactly what they say plus something bad
- "Trick" the user into running itself through an innocuous-looking program

## Viruses
- Modify a program to do something bad
- Can be spread by email, floppy disks, etc.
- Wraps some part of the code at the start of the program (initialization) and the back of the program

## Malware
- Independent malware
    - Trojan horses do not need a host because they are something that can run and sustain themselves (this is debatable)
    - Worms and bots
        - Worms will try to copy themselves to other computers on the same LAN or WAN
        - A bot or a zombie is a computer that is infected with a worm or backdoor and is controlled by a hacker
        - Bot code (malware) on the computer communicates with the attacker's server and carries out malicies activities per attacker's instructions
        - Botnet is a network of computers that are infected with a bot or a worm
            - Typically used to carry out DDoS attacks
- Dependent malware
    - Viruses need a host because they are a part of a program, while trojan horses are their own host

# About Me

## Who Am I?

Hello! My name is Anish Goyal, and I'm a Junior at GSMST. I am completely devoted to STEM and its applications on the world, especially using CS. Some of my hobbies are:

-   Programming (Fairly obvious, but I decided I would include it anyway!)
-   Hiking and camping in beautiful spots
-   Playing the violin
-   Mountain climbing
-   Tinkering with Arduino/Raspberry Pi

## What is my favorite IDE?

My favorite IDE used to be Visual Studio Code because it was lightweight and had many customizable features. However, I have discovered NeoVIM and have been in love with it ever since (Emacs is too fancy for me, but I occasionally use it too).![](images/image-1888474821.png)

# My Projects

This is a list of all of my recent projects and accomplishments!

## Polynomial Interpolation and K-Mean Mining to Predict Crime Rates

(what a fancy way of saying machine learning)!

## Rofi Abbreviator, Speller, Pronouncer, Thesaurus, and Dictionary (RASPTD)

A rofi GUI to help me with trivial English tasks.

## Pronouncer

## Thesaurus

## Dictionary

-   Unfortunately, I forgot to record a demonstration video for the dictionary.

-   My source that it exists? Trust me :)

## LaTeX screenshotter

A tool I developed to help me convert LaTeX math LaTeX source for my calculus notes.

## Let's test it!

Let's convert the following image into LaTeX:

# Other Work

## CyberPatriot

-   Under my leadership, CyberPatriot transformed from the least popular CS Club branch to the most popular CS Club branch.

-   I conducted cybersecurity seminars that were higher quality than institutions that were actually being *formally educated* with cybersecurity programs.

-   Our two gold teams got first and second place in the country. Our silver team got first place in the country. Our plat team got first place in the state.

-   This is, by far, my most proudest achievement.

## Capture the Flag

-   I also helped create Capture the Flag (CTF) seminars.

-   Upcoming CTF competition at our school.

-   Garnered interest in miscellaneous cybersecurity programs in our school (CyberStart America, picoCTF, etc.)

## Algorithmic/Advanced Programming

-   In addition to my algorithmic programming outside of school, I also help the *Advanced/Algorithmic Programming* division of CS Club at my school.

    -   I create slides for seminars, teach students basic algorithms and data structures

    -   e.g. DFS, Dijkstra's, BFS, some LeetCode/Codeforces problems, preparation for CodeQuest

-   Also aiding in the creation of an algorithmic programming competition to be held on March 30ths

## Robotics

-   FTC Red Robodragons 16796

    -   Two-time state champions in the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 seasons

    -   My autonomous code got us to worlds, despite it being canceled due to COVID that year.

-   Recipient of INSPIRE awards

-   Experimented with different types of machine learning and camera visioning algorithms with Rezznet as the backbone

    -   Conducted trials to see which ones performed the best

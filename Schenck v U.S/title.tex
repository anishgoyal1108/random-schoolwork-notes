{\small
In the case of Schenck v. United States (1919), the Supreme Court was tasked with determining the constitutionality of the Espionage and Sedition Acts, which were enacted during World War I to protect the war effort. This document aims to weigh the evidence and determine the innocence of Charles Schenck as expressed by a majority ruling of the Court.}\\

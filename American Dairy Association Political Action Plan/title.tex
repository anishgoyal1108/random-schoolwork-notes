{\small
The American Dairy Association proposes introducing a new variety of flavors of milk in schools across the country to increase students' milk intake and improve their overall health and nutrition while requiring the cooperation of all branches of government. The Association plans to work with the Executive and Legislative Branches to advocate for regulatory changes and legislation that supports their cause. The proposal also aims to create new markets for dairy farmers, boost the agricultural industry, and support local economies.}\\

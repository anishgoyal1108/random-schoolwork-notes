{\small
The assignment task was to select a contemporary primary source that could be essential for future generations to understand the current era of American history. The primary source that I chose was \textit{The 9/11 Commission Report}, which highlights the lack of coordination and sharing of information between different military departments, and how higher management was often unenthusiastic to taking action against Al-Qaeda, which eventually attacked the Twin Towers.}\\
